Train station distribution

The quantity and distribution of transportation infrastructure of a city measures connectivity and is an indicator of  an area's level of urbanization. Studying it is the first step to understand the city's structure. Visualizing data on the map provides a comparative perspective.

An single-page web app that visualizes train lines and train stations in Tokyo prefecture. The user can click a county and see the number of train stations in that county as well as its position in the train station number distribution.

The train stations are grouped by their owners and type:
